This is based on: https://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/

NOTE: I solved every user story except #4, I ran out of time (this repo was originally used for a company interview question)

I also didn't realize initially I could get all account
numbers I needed from the coding dojo website. So my sample.txt file will have slightly different account numbers than coding dojo. I was given this problem without any reference to coding dojo initially so I was unaware of the account numbers being available until much later in the coding process.

Installation Instructions:

1. Clone down the git repo
2. Navigate to the project director
3. You may want to type "gem install rspec"
5. This was coded with ruby 3.0.2 but I don't think I used anything that is not available in ruby 2.6 or maybe even ruby 2.4
6. From there you should be able to simply type: ruby main.rb (windows), I believe it will be ruby ./main.rb on UNIX systems
7. You should see output from the file put to the screen that does up to step #3 of this project
